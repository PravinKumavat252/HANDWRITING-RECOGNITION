# HANDWRITING-RECOGNITION

This project aims to build a deep learning model that can recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, with a basic neural network architecture. The project uses libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize the results.

## Project Overview
* Goal: To create a neural network model capable of classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

* Libraries Used:

    * numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.

    * matplotlib.pyplot: For visualizing data and results.

    * tensorflow.keras: For building, training, and evaluating the neural network.

    * tensorflow.keras.datasets: To load the MNIST dataset.

    * tensorflow.keras.utils: For converting labels to categorical format.

    * tensorflow.keras.callbacks: To implement early stopping during training to avoid overfitting.

## Dataset

The project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). These images are labeled with the corresponding digits (0-9). The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.

## Model Performance

After training, you should see the model's accuracy and loss on the test dataset. Depending on your hardware and training time, you can adjust the number of epochs, batch size, and the architecture of the model to improve performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwriting recognition using the MNIST dataset. By leveraging TensorFlow and Keras, the model learns to classify handwritten digits with high accuracy. You can further enhance the model by experimenting with more advanced architectures or hyperparameters.

## Future Improvements

* Experiment with different architectures such as deeper networks or use of dropout layers for regularization.
* Explore data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
* Use other datasets like EMNIST or custom handwriting datasets for real-world applications.
